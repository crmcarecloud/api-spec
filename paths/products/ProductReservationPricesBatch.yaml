    Batch process helps to add and synchronize multiple product reservation prices in one request.<br/> 
    ⚠️ If a product reservation price already exists, an update is applied. Missing parameters in update will be ignored and will not change. Erasing values is not possible here.<br/>
    ⚠️ Adjust batch sizes based on processing times. We recommended use maximum amount of 1000 records and adjust the batch size based on processing time.<br/>
    ⚠️ Endpoint is available only in the Enterprise interface.<br/>
