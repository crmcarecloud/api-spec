        - `interval`  The voucher is valid for a specific time interval after issuance. If you use this value, the parameter voucher_validity_value is mandatory and you need to add there an interval. For example *7 days, 1 year, 10 weeks, 30 minutes, etc*
        - `end_of_time_unit`  The voucher is valid until the end of a specific time unit, such as the end of a day, week, or month. If you use this value, the parameter voucher_validity_value is mandatory and you need to add there an interval. Possible values: *end_of_the_day / end_of_week / end_of_month / end_of_year*
        - `reward_validity`  The voucher's validity is linked to the validity period of the associated reward. In this case, there is no other value needs to be set and parameter `voucher_validity_value` is not mandatory and has no effect.
