## HTTP Bearer authentication
Bearer authentication (also called token authentication) is an HTTP authentication scheme that involves security tokens called bearer tokens. The name "Bearer authentication" can be understood as "give access to the bearer of this token." The bearer token is a cryptic string, usually generated by the server in response to a login request. The client must send this token in the Authorization header when making requests to protected resources:

```http request
Authorization: Bearer <token>
```

### Enterprise interface HTTP Bearer authentication

As described below, for authentication through HTTP Bearer, you will need a bearer token.

In REST API, you can get this token as a response from a successful call of [user login action method](#operation/postUserLogin).

For a successful login, you will need the ID of the external application and user credentials. If you miss any of these, please contact your account manager.

User login request :

```http request
POST https://<projectURL>/rest-api/enterprise-interface/v1.0/users/actions/login
Content-Type: application/json
Accept-Language: cs, en-gb;q=0.8

{
  "user_external_application_id": "4d9495b4e723e7a",
  "login": "example@crmcarecloud.com",
  "password": "password_example"
}
```

Bearer token in response of the method:

```json
{
  "data":{
    "bearer_token": "09359095c5da43c7ae11e710eabce49"
  }
}
```


After you successfully got your bearer token, please add it to every REST API call in the Enterprise interface with the following syntax:

```http request
GET http:<projectURL>/rest-api/customer-interface/v1.0/customers
Content-Type: application/json
Accept-Language: cs, en-gb;q=0.8
Authorization: Bearer 09359095c5da43c7ae11e710eabce49
```

Response:

```json
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Date: Mon, 22 Jul 2019 11:54:39 GMT
Content-Type: application/json; charset=utf-8
